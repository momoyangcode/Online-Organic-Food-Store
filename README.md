# Online-Organic-Food-Store

Website Description:

The website is an online organic food store, allowing users to browse and purchase a variety of vegetables. It features a slider showcasing different banners, a product display categorised into root vegetables, leafy greens, and other vegetables, and a shopping cart functionality where users can add products to their cart and purchase chosen products. Additionally, it displays 5 random vegetables when a user logs in.

Implementation of JavaScript Fundamental Skills:

1. Slider Implementation: The website incorporates a slider to display different product banners dynamically. The JavaScript code manages the slider functionality, including transitioning between slides, creating dots for navigation, and updating active slides.

2. Product Categorization: To categorise products, I used some array method(filter, map, for each, and so on) of the product data based on their category (root vegetables, leafy greens, and others), meanwhile dynamically rendered each product into its own products card in their respective containers, ensuring a clean and organised display for users.

3. Cart Functionality: Implementing the shopping cart functionality involved various JavaScript skills. I added event listeners to the cart buttons in every product’s card to handle adding products to the cart in the header, and also users can delete products by clicking the delete button in the cart. Moreover, the total price of items is calculated and displayed in the cart by updating the cart dynamically based on user interactions. I also implemented "like" buttons in product cards to change the colour when clicked.

4. User Login and Like Buttons: The website includes a user login feature where users can log in with their first name, last name, and gender(which we have in the users database). The JavaScript code validates user input and checks for matching user data to display a personalised welcome message upon successful login and also immediately add 5 random products in the user’s cart.

Challenges Faced and Overcoming::

1. Fetching and Filtering Data from Server
2. Shopping Cart Handling and Display Dynamically

Things I want to improve later:

1. CSS style: Later on I would like to implement “:root” for colours of the website and also write a tutorial for a better guide of styling the website
2. Clear JavaScript: Have more clear code, illustrate flowchart and architecture
3. Responsive Design: Unfortunately this time I didn’t have time to build a responsive website, but I will complete this project later on
4. More HTML Content: Add more sections(like recipes) to the page
5. More Functions: Make search products work and also want to add more functions in the shopping cart of each product card (E.g. Display and change product quantity dynamically along with the cart in the header)
6. Local Storage: Use local storage to keep track of the cart items when page loads.

Conclusion:
This is the first time that I independently create a web page with HTML,CSS and Javascript after the course, I realise that there are still a lot of new things that I need to learn and improve, it was challenging to finish all the tasks but I did most of it, there are still a lot of things I would like to implement but I think I need to take more time and learn more to be able to complete it.
